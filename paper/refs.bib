Nevertheless, some pitfalls for the use of these techniques should be taken into account in order to avoid coding artifacts. The implementation of intensity stereo coding techniques will be described with respect to Layer Ill of the ISO/MPEG/AUDIO coder and its backward compatible multi-channel extension under MPEG-2.}, author={Herre, J. and Lederer, D. and Brandenburg, K.}, year={1994}, keywords={data compression}, language={en} }

    abstract = {The dependence of binaural masked thresholds on the interaural phase relations of both the signal tone and the noise has been demonstrated in previous studies, and has been repeated here for a wide band of noise (200–4000 cps). A second experiment was carried out to test whether this dependence extended to the remote masking of low‐frequency tones by a high‐frequency band of noise (2000–4000 cps). The results indicate that a phase reversal of the tone at the two ears has the same effect in remote masking as in ordinary masking; but a phase reversal of the high‐frequency band at the two ears produces changes in the masked threshold midway between those encountered in ordinary masking and no change at all. The results are interpreted as indicating that the interaural time relations between the remote‐masking sources that result from a phase reversal of the high‐frequency band involve a time shift of about one half‐period of the band midfrequency and a decrease in the interaural correlation.},
